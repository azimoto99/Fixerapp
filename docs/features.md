## Location Verification System

### Overview
The Location Verification System ensures that workers are physically present at job sites when starting and working on jobs. This system prevents location spoofing and provides security for both workers and job posters.

### Anti-Cheating Measures

#### Multi-Layer Verification
- **GPS Accuracy Validation**: Requires GPS accuracy better than 100m
- **Distance Verification**: Workers must be within 500m of job site to start
- **Timestamp Validation**: Location data must be fresh (within 5 minutes)
- **Device Consistency**: Tracks device fingerprints and user agents
- **Pattern Analysis**: Detects impossible travel speeds and suspicious patterns

#### Continuous Monitoring
- **Periodic Checks**: Location verified every 5 minutes during job execution
- **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate notifications if worker moves too far
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintains verification history for audit trails
- **Automatic Warnings**: Alerts job posters of verification failures

#### Advanced Security Features
- **IP Address Tracking**: Monitors for VPN/proxy usage
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Detects device changes mid-job
- **Geofencing**: Expanded monitoring zone (1km) during job execution
- **Speed Analysis**: Flags impossible travel between locations
- **Repeated Coordinate Detection**: Identifies potential GPS spoofing

### Implementation Details

#### Backend Components
- **LocationVerificationService**: Core verification logic with Haversine formula
- **Job Location API**: Endpoints for starting jobs and ongoing verification
- **Database Schema**: Stores verification history and device information

#### Frontend Components
- **LocationVerificationModal**: High-accuracy GPS location capture
- **JobLocationMonitor**: Real-time monitoring during job execution
- **useJobLocationMonitoring**: React hook for location tracking

#### Verification Confidence Levels
- **High**: <100m distance, <50m GPS accuracy
- **Medium**: 100-200m distance, moderate accuracy
- **Low**: 200-500m distance, lower accuracy
- **Rejected**: >500m distance or failed security checks
