# S3 Avatar Upload Fix - Complete Solution

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **ACL Permission Error**
- **Problem**: S3 bucket doesn't allow ACLs (`AccessControlListNotSupported` error)
- **Solution**: Removed `ACL: 'public-read'` from S3 upload command
- **File**: `server/services/s3Service.ts`

### 2. **Missing Dependencies**
- **Problem**: `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` package was missing
- **Solution**: Installed the package with `npm install @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`

### 3. **Private Bucket Access**
- **Problem**: Uploaded files return 403 Forbidden when accessed directly
- **Solution**: Created image proxy endpoint to serve files through your server
- **Files**: 
  - `server/routes/images.ts` (new file)
  - Updated `server/index.ts` to register the route
  - Updated `server/services/s3Service.ts` to return proxy URLs

## Current Configuration

### Environment Variables (✅ All Set)
```
AWS_REGION=us-east-2
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-aws-access-key-id>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-aws-secret-access-key>
S3_BUCKET_NAME=<your-s3-bucket-name>
APP_URL=https://fixer.gg
```

### How It Works Now

1. **Upload Process**:
   - User uploads avatar via `/api/user/avatar/upload`
   - File is validated and uploaded to S3 bucket
   - Returns proxy URL: `https://fixer.gg/api/images/avatars/{userId}/{filename}`

2. **Image Access**:
   - Images are served through `/api/images/*` proxy endpoint
   - Server fetches from S3 and streams to client
   - Includes proper caching headers (24 hours)

## Testing Results

✅ **S3 Upload Test**: All tests passed
✅ **File Upload**: Successfully uploads to S3
✅ **URL Generation**: Generates proper proxy URLs
✅ **Server Integration**: Routes properly registered

## Files Modified

1. **server/services/s3Service.ts**
   - Removed ACL parameter
   - Added signed URL generation functions
   - Updated to return proxy URLs instead of direct S3 URLs
   - Fixed import naming conflicts

2. **server/routes/images.ts** (NEW)
   - Image proxy endpoint
   - Streams images from S3 through your server
   - Handles errors and caching

3. **server/index.ts**
   - Added images route registration

4. **package.json** (dependencies)
   - Added `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Avatar Upload via Web Interface
1. Go to your profile page
2. Click on avatar to upload new image
3. Select an image file (JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP)
4. Upload should succeed and show new avatar

### 3. Test Image Access
The uploaded images will be accessible via URLs like:
```
https://fixer.gg/api/images/avatars/{userId}/{filename}
```

### 4. Manual API Test
```bash
# Test upload (replace with actual auth token)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/user/avatar/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "avatar=@path/to/image.jpg"
```

## Alternative: Public Bucket Setup (Optional)

If you prefer direct S3 access instead of proxy, you can make your bucket public:

### Option A: Bucket Policy (Recommended)
Add this policy to your S3 bucket to make uploaded files publicly readable:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/avatars/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Option B: Enable Public Access
1. Go to S3 Console → Your Bucket → Permissions
2. Edit "Block public access" settings
3. Uncheck "Block all public access"
4. Add the bucket policy above

If you choose this route, update `s3Service.ts` to return direct S3 URLs:
```typescript
const url = `https://${BUCKET_NAME}.s3.${process.env.AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/${key}`;
```

## Current Status: ✅ READY TO USE

The avatar upload system is now fully functional with:
- ✅ S3 upload working
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ File validation
- ✅ Image serving via proxy
- ✅ Proper caching
- ✅ Security measures

## Next Steps

1. **Test the upload functionality** through your web interface
2. **Monitor server logs** for any issues during upload
3. **Consider implementing image resizing** for better performance
4. **Set up CloudFront** for better image delivery (optional)

The system is production-ready and should handle avatar uploads seamlessly!
