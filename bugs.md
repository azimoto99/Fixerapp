# Fixer App - Bug Report

This document tracks identified bugs and issues in the Fixer application codebase.

## Active Bugs

### Bug 5: Memory Leak in WebSocket Context
**Status: OPEN**
- **Location**: `client/src/contexts/WebSocketContext.tsx`
- **Issue**: The message handler callback doesn't have all dependencies in its dependency array, potentially causing stale closures.
- **Impact**: Messages might not be processed correctly after user state changes.
- **Fix Recommendation**: 
  - Add all used variables to the dependency array of the handleMessage useCallback
  - Consider using useRef for values that shouldn't trigger callback recreation

### Bug 9: Missing Error Handling in Jobs API
**Status: OPEN**
- **Location**: `server/api/jobs.ts`
- **Issue**: The POST endpoint for creating jobs has an incomplete try/catch block that doesn't properly close the function in the catch block.
- **Impact**: Server could crash or hang when errors occur during job creation.
- **Fix Recommendation**: 
  - Complete the catch block with proper return statement
  - Add specific error handling for different types of errors

## Previously Fixed Bugs

### ✅ Bug 1: WebSocket Connection Error Handling
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `client/src/hooks/useWebSocketUnified.ts`
- **Issue**: The WebSocket connection error handling has a potential issue where the circuit breaker pattern might prevent reconnection attempts even after the timeout period if the user refreshes the page.
- **Fix**: Implemented proper circuit breaker reset logic and added sessionStorage to persist state across page refreshes.

### ✅ Bug 2: Missing WebSocket Server Implementation
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `server/index.ts`
- **Issue**: The WebSocket server was initialized but the connection handler was empty, missing the implementation for handling WebSocket events.
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive WebSocket connection handler with message type processing.

### ✅ Bug 3: Authentication Session Security Issue
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `server/auth.ts`
- **Issue**: The session secret was using a fallback hardcoded value when SESSION_SECRET environment variable is not set.
- **Fix**: Implemented secure random session secret generation with proper warnings and production mode enforcement.

### ✅ Bug 4: Incomplete Error Handling in Routes
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `server/routes.ts`
- **Issue**: The error handler at the end of the routes registration throws the error after sending a response, which can cause unhandled promise rejections.
- **Fix**: Removed the `throw err` statement after sending the error response and added proper error logging.

### ✅ Bug 6: Missing Cleanup in App.tsx
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `client/src/App.tsx`
- **Issue**: Event listeners for 'open-messaging' and 'open-profile' are added but not properly cleaned up if the component re-renders with different dependencies.
- **Fix**: Added proper cleanup functions in useEffect return callbacks.

### ✅ Bug 7: Case-Insensitive Username Lookup Performance Issue
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `server/auth.ts`
- **Issue**: When a username exact match fails, the code fetches ALL users and performs a case-insensitive search in memory.
- **Fix**: Modified the database query to perform case-insensitive search directly in the database with a new getUserByUsernameInsensitive method.

### ✅ Bug 8: Stripe API Version Hardcoded to Future Date
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `server/stripe-integration.ts`
- **Issue**: The Stripe API version was hardcoded to '2025-05-28.basil', which is a future date that doesn't exist yet.
- **Fix**: Updated to a current valid Stripe API version ('2023-10-16').

### ✅ Bug 10: Potential SQL Injection in SQL Sanitization Function
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `server/sql-injection-protection.ts`
- **Issue**: The sanitizeSqlInput function doesn't properly handle all SQL injection vectors, particularly those using Unicode characters or alternative syntax.
- **Fix**: Enhanced the sanitization function to handle Unicode characters and improved pattern matching.

### ✅ Bug 11: Insecure AWS Credentials Handling
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `server/api/messaging-api.ts`
- **Issue**: AWS credentials are initialized with empty strings when environment variables are not set, instead of failing fast.
- **Fix**: Added proper validation of AWS credentials at startup with appropriate warnings.

### ✅ Bug 12: Database Connection Pool Configuration Issues
**STATUS: FIXED**
- **Location**: `server/db.ts`
- **Issue**: The database connection pool has conflicting timeout settings (statement_timeout vs query_timeout) and doesn't properly handle connection failures.
- **Fix**: Standardized timeout settings across configuration and improved error handling.

### ✅ Bug 13: Unhandled Promise Rejection in WebSocket Context
**STATUS: FIXED**
- **Location**: `client/src/contexts/WebSocketContext.tsx`
- **Issue**: The handleMessage function doesn't properly handle promise rejections that might occur during query invalidation.
- **Fix**: Added try/catch blocks around async operations in the message handler and implemented proper error logging.

### ✅ Bug 14: Missing Rate Limiting for WebSocket Connections
**STATUS: FIXED**
- **Location**: `server/index.ts`
- **Issue**: While HTTP endpoints have rate limiting, WebSocket connections don't have any rate limiting or connection throttling.
- **Fix**: Implemented connection rate limiting for WebSocket connections with IP-based throttling and per-user message rate limiting.

### ✅ Bug 15: Improper Content Security Policy Configuration
**STATUS: FIXED**
- **Location**: `server/index.ts`
- **Issue**: The Content Security Policy is set directly in the response headers instead of using Helmet's CSP configuration.
- **Fix**: Switched to using Helmet's CSP configuration with properly defined directives for all required resources.

### ✅ Bug: Stripe Initialization Fails Silently
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `client/src/pages/checkout.tsx`
- **Issue**: Application logged console errors when VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY was missing but didn't throw errors, causing runtime failures in Stripe components instead of failing fast at startup
- **Fix**: Added proper error throwing and error boundary for Stripe initialization

### ✅ Bug: Refactor Breaks Error Handling and Authentication  
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `client/src/components/stripe/StripeRequirementsCheck.tsx`
- **Issue**: Concerns about error handling and authentication in user data refresh
- **Fix**: Enhanced error handling with proper JSON parsing and specific error logging

### ✅ Bug: API Request Handling and Authentication Issues  
**Status: VERIFIED**
- **Location**: `client/src/components/stripe/StripeRequirementsCheck.tsx`
- **Issue**: Concerns about API request handling and authentication
- **Analysis**: Code review shows proper implementation

### ✅ Bug: Earnings Calculation Miscalibration
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `client/src/components/applications/ApplicationForm.tsx` and `client/src/components/PostJobSuccessModal.tsx`
- **Issue**: Inconsistent service fee display - UI showed 5% fee but earnings calculated with 10% fee
- **Fix**: Updated service fee to consistently show 10% across all components

### ✅ Bug: API Error Handling Removed
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `client/src/components/profile/BadgesDisplay.tsx`
- **Issue**: Missing error handling when switching from fetch() to apiRequest()
- **Fix**: Added explicit response.ok checks and error throwing

## Summary
- 2 active bugs identified
- 18 previously fixed bugs documented
- Most critical issues relate to security, WebSocket implementation, and error handling
- Several potential performance bottlenecks identified in database and authentication code
