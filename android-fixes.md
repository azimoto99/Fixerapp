# Android Fix Guide

This guide explains the fixes implemented to solve the white screen and broken icon issues on Android.

## Changes Made

1. **Image Format Changed**:
   - Switched from SVG to PNG files for app icons and logos
   - SVG files don't work natively on Android without special configuration

2. **Metro Configuration Updated**:
   - Enhanced `metro.config.js` to properly handle assets
   - Added SVG transformer support

3. **App.expo.js Updated**:
   - Added proper image loading for the Fixer logo
   - Implemented better error handling for white screen scenarios

## How to Build with These Changes

1. Use the updated `build-android-fix.sh` script before building
2. Run your Android build with the `--non-interactive` flag
3. These changes should resolve both the white screen and broken icon issues

## Testing the App

To verify the fixes worked:
1. Build the APK using EAS build
2. Install on your Android device
3. Verify the app launches properly with icons displayed correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:
- Make sure Expo has access to the PNG image files
- Verify your Android SDK and build tools are properly configured
- Check the logs during the build process for any asset bundling errors
