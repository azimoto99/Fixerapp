## ✅ Bug 5: Stripe Initialization Fails Silently
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `client/src/pages/checkout.tsx`
- **Issue**: Application logged console errors when VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY was missing but didn't throw errors, causing runtime failures in Stripe components instead of failing fast at startup
- **Fix**: Added proper error throwing and error boundary for Stripe initialization
- **Changes**:
  - Modified Stripe key validation to throw error immediately when VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY is missing
  - Added descriptive error message for missing environment variable
  - Simplified stripePromise initialization (removed conditional null assignment)
  - Added StripeErrorBoundary component to catch and display Stripe initialization errors
  - Wrapped Elements component with error boundary for graceful error handling
  - **Result**: Application now fails fast at startup when Stripe configuration is missing, preventing runtime crashes

## ✅ Bug 4: Refactor Breaks Error Handling and Authentication  
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `client/src/components/stripe/StripeRequirementsCheck.tsx`
- **Issue**: Concerns about error handling and authentication in user data refresh
- **Fix**: Enhanced error handling with proper JSON parsing and specific error logging
- **Changes**:
  - Added explicit JSON parsing error handling with try/catch
  - Enhanced error logging with specific error type detection
  - Improved success logging to only occur after successful JSON parsing
  - Maintained authentication security (credentials included by apiRequest by default)
  - **Result**: Robust error handling prevents runtime crashes and provides clear error reporting

## ✅ Bug 1: API Request Handling and Authentication Issues  
**Status: VERIFIED**
- **Location**: `client/src/components/stripe/StripeRequirementsCheck.tsx`
- **Issue**: Concerns about API request handling and authentication
- **Analysis**: Code review shows proper implementation
- **Changes**: 
  - Verified that `apiRequest` function already includes `credentials: 'include'` by default
  - Verified that `response.ok` check is handled internally by `apiRequest` function
  - Current implementation correctly calls `response.json()` on the Response object
  - **No changes needed** - code is already properly implemented

## ✅ Bug 2: Earnings Calculation Miscalibration
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `client/src/components/applications/ApplicationForm.tsx` and `client/src/components/PostJobSuccessModal.tsx`
- **Issue**: Inconsistent service fee display - UI showed 5% fee but earnings calculated with 10% fee
- **Fix**: Updated service fee to consistently show 10% across all components
- **Changes**:
  - ApplicationForm.tsx: Updated service fee display from 5% to 10% (0.05 → 0.10)
  - ApplicationForm.tsx: Confirmed worker earnings calculation uses 90% (0.90)
  - PostJobSuccessModal.tsx: Updated service fee notice from 5% to 10%
  - **Result**: Consistent 10% service fee across all UI components

## ✅ Bug 3: API Error Handling Removed
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `client/src/components/profile/BadgesDisplay.tsx`
- **Issue**: Missing error handling when switching from fetch() to apiRequest()
- **Fix**: Added explicit response.ok checks and error throwing
- **Changes**:
  - Added `response.ok` check for user badges API call
  - Added `response.ok` check for all badges API call  
  - Added descriptive error messages for failed requests
  - **Result**: Robust error handling prevents runtime errors on API failures
