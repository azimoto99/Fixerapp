## ✅ Bug 1: Loading State Overridden in Stripe Connect Context
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `client/src/contexts/stripe-connect-context.tsx`
- **Issue**: isLoading property was hardcoded to false
- **Fix**: Updated to use actual loading state from useStripeConnectMonitor hook
- **Changes**: 
  - Added isLoading to destructured returns in both files
  - Context now properly reflects actual loading state from the hook

## ✅ Bug 2: Session Health Check Returns Inconsistent Values  
**Status: FIXED**
- **Location**: `client/src/hooks/use-session-monitor.ts`
- **Issue**: checkSessionHealth function didn't consistently return boolean values
- **Fix**: Added explicit return type Promise<boolean> and ensured all code paths return boolean
- **Changes**:
  - Function now returns true for healthy sessions
  - Returns false for session issues or errors
  - Consistent boolean return values for all code paths

## ✅ Bug 3: Session Monitor Cleanup Logic Error
**Status: FIXED**  
- **Location**: `client/src/hooks/use-session-monitor.ts`
- **Issue**: Memory leak due to conditional cleanup logic in useEffect
- **Fix**: Restructured cleanup logic to properly clear all intervals
- **Changes**:
  - Made frequentInterval a scoped variable that's properly cleaned up
  - Added sessionDuration to useEffect dependencies
  - Ensured all intervals are cleared in cleanup

## ✅ Bug 4: Admin Check Bypass Vulnerability
**Status: ALREADY FIXED**
- **Location**: `client/src/pages/AdminPanelV2.tsx`
- **Issue**: Hardcoded user ID check bypassing proper role-based access control
- **Status**: Code review shows only proper `user?.isAdmin === true` check present
- **No changes needed**: Security vulnerability already resolved
