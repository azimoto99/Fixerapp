app.get('/api/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    version: process.env.npm_package_version || '1.0.0'
  });
});
```

### 2. Add Basic Analytics
```typescript
// Track key user actions
app.use('/api', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`API Call: ${req.method} ${req.path} - User: ${req.user?.id || 'anonymous'}`);
  next();
});
```

### 3. Improve Error Messages
```typescript
// Better error responses
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
  res.status(err.status || 500).json({
    message: err.message,
    ...(isDev && { stack: err.stack }),
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});
```
