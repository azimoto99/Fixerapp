# Posted Jobs Drawer - Security & UX Improvements

## Overview
Comprehensive security fixes and UI/UX improvements for the "My Posted Jobs" drawer to ensure users can only see their own jobs and provide a better user experience.

## Security Issues Fixed

- **Error Handling**: Returns 403 Forbidden when unauthorized access is attempted

### 2. **Client-Side Security Validation**
- **User ID Verification**: Only fetches jobs when user is properly authenticated
- **Response Filtering**: Client-side validation ensures all returned jobs belong to current user
- **Security Warnings**: Logs warnings if server returns unauthorized jobs
