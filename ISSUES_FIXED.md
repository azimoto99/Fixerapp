# Fixer App - Issues Fixed

## Summary of Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Database Connection Issues
**Problem**: Database experiencing termination errors and connection instability
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced database connection configuration with better error handling
- Reduced connection pool size to prevent overwhelming the database
- Added connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- Improved session store configuration

### 2. Missing Import in App.tsx
**Problem**: `useAppConnections` hook was referenced but not imported
**Solution**: Added proper import for the hook

### 3. Database Storage Implementation Issues
**Problem**: Some methods in the storage layer were not properly implemented
**Solution**: Enhanced the unified storage implementation with better error handling

### 4. Environment Configuration
**Problem**: Environment variables were properly set but database connection was unstable
**Solution**: Improved database connection resilience

## Files Modified

1. **server/db.ts** - Enhanced database connection configuration
2. **client/src/App.tsx** - Added missing import
3. **server/unified-storage.ts** - Improved error handling and method implementations

## Current Status

The app should now:
- ✅ Have stable database connections with retry logic
- ✅ Properly handle connection errors without crashing
- ✅ Have all required imports in the frontend
- ✅ Have comprehensive error handling in the storage layer

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application** - Run `npm run dev` to verify fixes
2. **Monitor database connections** - Check for any remaining connection issues
3. **Test core functionality** - Verify user registration, job posting, and payments work
4. **Performance optimization** - Monitor and optimize database queries if needed

## Key Improvements Made

### Database Resilience
- Reduced max connections from 20 to 10 to prevent overwhelming Supabase
- Added connection timeout and retry logic
- Enhanced error handling that doesn't crash the application
- Better session store configuration

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks in storage operations
- Graceful fallbacks for database errors
- Proper error logging without exposing sensitive information

### Code Quality
- Fixed missing imports and dependencies
- Improved type safety
- Better separation of concerns

The application should now be much more stable and handle database issues gracefully.
