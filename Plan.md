# Fixer App MVP Development Plan

This document outlines the roadmap to complete the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Fixer app, a gig work platform connecting clients with skilled individuals for various tasks. The plan is broken into small, actionable steps with estimated completion percentages to track progress. Tasks are sorted by priority, with critical user-facing features and blockers at the top. As tasks are completed, this document will be updated to reflect the current status.

## 1. Admin Panel Fixes (Priority: High, Current Completion: 75%)
The admin panel is critical for managing the platform but currently displays a 'Something Went Wrong' error.
- [X] **Diagnose Data Mismatch**: Review server logs and add detailed error logging to identify the root cause of data display issues. (100%)
- [X] **Fix Data Fetching**: Correct the API endpoint or data structure mismatch between backend and frontend. (100%)
- [ ] **Test Admin Panel**: Verify that payments and user data load correctly without errors. (0%)
- [ ] **Add User Management Features**: Implement basic user suspension or role changes. (0%)

## 2. High Accuracy Location Services (Priority: High, Current Completion: 30%)
Location services are partially implemented but high accuracy mode is not working as expected, which is crucial for job coordination.
- [ ] **Review Location Permissions** (Light): Ensure permission requests are correctly handled on all platforms (iOS/Android/Web). (50%)
- [ ] **Implement Fallback Logic** (Light): Add fallback to lower accuracy if high accuracy fails, with user notification. (0%)
- [ ] **Test Location Accuracy** (Heavy): Conduct real-world tests to confirm location data is precise enough for job coordination. (0%)
- [ ] **Integrate Location with Job Posting** (Heavy): Ensure location data is correctly attached to job posts and visible to relevant users. (0%)

## 3. Job Workflow Improvements (Priority: High, Current Completion: 60%)
Core job posting and application features are in place, but the workflow needs polish for a seamless user experience.
- [ ] **Add Job Status Updates** (Light): Allow users to update job status (e.g., in progress, completed) with notifications. (20%)
- [ ] **Enhance Application Filtering** (Light): Let clients filter applications by rating, location, or other criteria. (0%)
- [ ] **Implement Job Completion Flow** (Medium): Add a clear process for marking jobs as complete with mutual agreement. (0%)
- [ ] **Test Full Job Cycle** (Heavy): Simulate a job from posting to completion to identify any UX issues. (50%)

## 4. Payment System Enhancements (Priority: Medium-High, Current Completion: 70%)
Stripe integration is functional, but additional features are needed for a seamless experience.
- [ ] **Add Payment History** (Light): Display a detailed transaction history for users. (0%)
- [ ] **Implement Dispute Resolution** (Medium): Add a basic system for users to report payment issues. (0%)
- [ ] **Test Edge Cases** (Heavy): Verify payment processing handles failures, refunds, and Stripe account issues gracefully. (50%)

## 5. Complete Messaging Functionality (Priority: Medium-High, Current Completion: 40%)
Basic messaging is in place, but advanced features like file attachments are missing.
- [X] **Add File Attachment Endpoint** (Light): Create a server endpoint for uploading and sharing files in messages. (100%)
- [ ] **Integrate File Upload in UI** (Medium): Update the messaging interface to allow file selection and display uploaded files. (50%)
- [ ] **Implement Message Read Receipts** (Light): Add functionality to show if messages have been read. (0%)
- [ ] **Add Group Messaging** (Medium): Enable messaging for multiple users related to a job. (0%)
- [ ] **Test Messaging Stability** (Heavy): Ensure messages are delivered reliably under various network conditions. (0%)

## 6. User Experience and Onboarding (Priority: Medium, Current Completion: 50%)
Basic onboarding exists, but more guidance is needed for new users.
- [ ] **Add Interactive Tutorials** (Medium): Create step-by-step guides for first-time users on key actions (posting a job, applying). (0%)
- [ ] **Improve Profile Setup** (Light): Streamline the process for setting up a profile with contextual tips. (50%)
- [ ] **Gather User Feedback** (Light): Add a simple feedback form to collect UX improvement suggestions. (0%)

## 7. Performance and Stability (Priority: Medium, Current Completion: 40%)
The app is functional but needs optimization for a production environment.
- [ ] **Optimize API Calls** (Light): Reduce unnecessary data fetching and implement caching where appropriate. (0%)
- [ ] **Add Error Boundaries** (Light): Ensure UI errors don't crash the app by adding React error boundaries. (50%)
- [ ] **Conduct Load Testing** (Heavy): Test app performance with multiple concurrent users to identify bottlenecks. (0%)
- [ ] **Fix Linter Errors** (Light): Resolve remaining TypeScript and ESLint issues for cleaner code. (50%)

## 8. Security and Privacy (Priority: Medium-Low, Current Completion: 30%)
Basic security is implemented, but additional measures are needed.
- [ ] **Enhance Data Encryption** (Medium): Ensure sensitive data like location and payments are encrypted in transit and at rest. (50%)
- [ ] **Add Privacy Controls** (Light): Allow users to control who sees their location and profile details. (0%)
- [ ] **Audit Authentication** (Heavy): Verify auth tokens and session management prevent unauthorized access. (0%)

## Overall MVP Completion: ~50%

This plan will be updated as tasks are completed. Each section includes actionable steps to ensure steady progress toward the MVP launch. Developers should focus on completing one subsection at a time, testing thoroughly before moving to the next.
