I need to redesign the profile tab in my UserDrawerV2 component. It currently shows duplicate information and has poor organization.

CURRENT PROBLEMS WITH PROFILE TAB:
- Duplicate user info appearing in multiple places
- Stats scattered throughout without clear hierarchy
- Poor visual organization and spacing
- Missing important profile elements
- Redundant data displays

REDESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR PROFILE TAB:

**New Layout Structure:**
┌─ PROFILE TAB ────────────────┐

**Section 1: User Identity**
- Profile avatar (larger, prominent)
- Full name and username
- Member since date
- Star rating with review count
- Location (city/state)

**Section 2: Performance Stats**
- Jobs completed (remove duplicates)
- Total earnings to date
- Strike count (only show if > 0)
- Success rate percentage
- Average rating

**Section 3: Recent Activity**
- Last 3-5 completed jobs
- Show job type and time completed
- Quick glance at recent work history

**Section 4: Account Management**
- Edit profile button
- Settings/preferences
- Help/support links
- Sign out option

SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED:
1. **Remove Duplicate Data:** Consolidate repeated user stats into single display
2. **Better Visual Hierarchy:** Group related info together with clear sections
3. **Cleaner Spacing:** Add proper margins/padding between sections
4. **Prioritize Important Info:** Show most relevant stats prominently
5. **Remove Clutter:** Hide less important details or move to settings

PRESERVE THESE FEATURES:
- User authentication state
- Profile editing functionality
- Navigation to other sections
- Current styling theme
- Loading states and error handling

REMOVE/CONSOLIDATE:
- Duplicate job counts
- Repeated user name displays
- Scattered stat displays
- Redundant buttons/links
- Unnecessary text labels

Redesign this profile tab to be clean, organized, and informative without redundancy. Focus on the most important user information and core job stats in a logical hierarchy.
