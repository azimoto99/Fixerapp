Gig Work App Module Consolidation Assessment
Overview
I need to consolidate multiple implementations of modules in my gig work app that were created by Replit, ensuring no functionality is lost in the process.
Current Situation Analysis
1. Module Inventory
Please list each module that has multiple implementations:

Module Name:
Number of different implementations:
File locations/paths:
Brief description of what the module does:

Repeat for each module
2. Implementation Details
For each module with multiple implementations, describe:
Implementation A:

File path/location:
Key features it handles:
Dependencies it uses:
Unique functionality (what only this version does):
Current status (working/broken/partial):

Implementation B:

File path/location:
Key features it handles:
Dependencies it uses:
Unique functionality (what only this version does):
Current status (working/broken/partial):

Continue for additional implementations
3. App Context

Main app functionality: (e.g., job matching, payment processing, scheduling, user management)
Current tech stack: (languages, frameworks, databases)
Which implementation is currently live/in use?
Are there any breaking changes between implementations?
Any critical deadlines for this consolidation?

4. Specific Concerns

Data compatibility: Do different implementations use different data structures?
API compatibility: Are there different endpoint structures or response formats?
Configuration differences: Environment variables, settings files, etc.
Testing coverage: Which implementations have tests?

5. Success Criteria
What does successful consolidation look like?

All current functionality preserved: ☐
Single source of truth for each module: ☐
No duplicate code: ☐
Improved maintainability: ☐
Other specific goals:
