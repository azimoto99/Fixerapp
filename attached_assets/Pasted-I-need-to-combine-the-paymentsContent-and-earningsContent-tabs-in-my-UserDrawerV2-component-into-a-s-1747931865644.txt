I need to combine the paymentsContent and earningsContent tabs in my UserDrawerV2 component into a single "Wallet" tab.

CURRENT ISSUE:
- I have separate tabs for "Payments" and "Earnings" in UserDrawerV2
- This creates redundant/confusing UI
- Users need to see all financial info in one place

REQUIREMENTS FOR COMBINED "WALLET" TAB:

**Section 1: Current Balance**
- Display total wallet balance prominently at top
- Show available funds vs pending funds separately
- Add "Withdraw Funds" button

**Section 2: Recent Transactions** 
- Combine both payment history and earnings history
- Show chronological list of all transactions
- Include: job earnings, bonuses, withdrawals, fees
- Display: amount, date, transaction type, job title (if applicable)

**Section 3: Earnings Summary**
- Total earned (lifetime)
- This week's earnings
- Average per job
- Streak bonuses earned

**Layout Structure:**
┌─ WALLET TAB ─────────────────┐
│ 💰 Balance: $127.50         │
│ 📤 [Withdraw Funds]         │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Recent Transactions         │
│ • +$25.00 - House Cleaning  │
│ • +$2.50 - Streak Bonus     │
│ • -$50.00 - Withdrawal      │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Earnings Summary            │
│ Total Earned: $847.50       │
│ This Week: $127.50          │
│ Avg per Job: $18.75         │
└─────────────────────────────┘

SPECIFIC CHANGES NEEDED:
1. Remove separate "Payments" and "Earnings" tabs
2. Create single "Wallet" tab that merges both content areas
3. Reorganize the data display as shown above
4. Keep all existing functionality but in unified interface
5. Maintain the same styling/theme as current drawer

PRESERVE EXISTING FEATURES:
- Withdrawal functionality
- Transaction filtering/sorting
- Date formatting
- Error handling
- Loading states

Merge these two tabs into one cohesive wallet interface that shows all financial information in a logical, user-friendly layout.
