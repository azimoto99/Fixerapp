I need to make my Fixer app fully responsive across all device sizes. Currently it only works well on one screen size and breaks on others.

CURRENT RESPONSIVE ISSUES:
- Layout breaks on mobile phones (elements overlap, text too small)
- Desktop version wastes space with poor layout
- Tablet view has awkward sizing and spacing
- Navigation doesn't adapt to different screen sizes
- Maps and modals don't resize properly

RESPONSIVE BREAKPOINTS TO IMPLEMENT:

**Mobile (320px - 768px)**
- Single column layout for all content
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px)
- Collapsible navigation menu (hamburger)
- Full-width job cards
- Stack form elements vertically
- Larger text for readability

**Tablet (768px - 1024px)**  
- Two-column layout where appropriate
- Larger touch targets
- Side navigation or expanded tabs
- Grid layout for job listings (2 columns)
- Modal dialogs sized appropriately

**Desktop (1024px+)**
- Multi-column layouts
- Sidebar navigation
- Larger map area
- Grid layouts (3-4 columns for job cards)
- Hover states and desktop interactions

SPECIFIC COMPONENTS TO FIX:

**Navigation/Header:**
- Mobile: Hamburger menu, collapsible
- Tablet: Horizontal tabs or vertical sidebar
- Desktop: Full horizontal navigation bar

**Job Map:**
- Mobile: Full screen height, bottom sheet for job details
- Tablet: 60% screen height, side panel for details
- Desktop: Split view with job list sidebar

**Job Cards/Listings:**
- Mobile: Single column, full width cards
- Tablet: 2-column grid layout
- Desktop: 3-4 column grid or list view option

**UserDrawerV2:**
- Mobile: Full screen overlay
- Tablet: Slide-in panel (300px width)
- Desktop: Fixed sidebar or larger modal

**Forms (Job Posting, Profile Edit):**
- Mobile: Single column, stacked inputs
- Tablet: Two-column for shorter forms
- Desktop: Optimized multi-column layouts

**Modals/Popups:**
- Mobile: Full screen or bottom sheet
- Tablet: Centered modal (70% screen width)
- Desktop: Centered modal (40-50% screen width)

CSS MEDIA QUERIES NEEDED:
```css
/* Mobile First Approach */
@media (max-width: 767px) {
  /* Mobile styles */
}

@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px) {
  /* Tablet styles */  
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  /* Desktop styles */
}

@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  /* Large desktop */
}
TOUCH VS MOUSE INTERACTIONS:

Mobile: Touch gestures, swipe navigation
Desktop: Hover effects, right-click menus
Tablet: Both touch and precision pointing

TYPOGRAPHY SCALING:

Mobile: Base 16px, headers 24-32px
Tablet: Base 16px, headers 28-36px
Desktop: Base 16px, headers 32-48px

SPACING AND LAYOUT:

Mobile: Tighter spacing, more vertical layout
Tablet: Moderate spacing, mixed layouts
Desktop: Generous spacing, horizontal emphasis

SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED:

Container Widths: Set max-widths and fluid containers
Flexbox/Grid: Implement responsive grid systems
Image Scaling: Make all images responsive
Button Sizing: Ensure touch-friendly sizes on mobile
Text Scaling: Prevent text from being too small on mobile
Navigation: Implement collapsible mobile menu
Map Responsiveness: Adjust map height/width by screen size
Modal Behavior: Different modal styles per device type

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:

Test on actual devices (iPhone, Android, iPad, desktop)
Check portrait and landscape orientations
Verify touch targets are large enough
Ensure no horizontal scrolling on mobile
Test all interactive elements work on touch

Make my entire Fixer app responsive with proper breakpoints, touch-friendly interfaces, and optimized layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop users. Focus especially on the map, job listings, navigation, and user drawer components.
