# Fixer Platform Cleanup & Optimization Strategy

## Current Status
- âœ… Created organized route structure (auth, jobs, payments, messaging)
- âœ… Set up middleware organization for security
- âœ… Established centralized route index
- ðŸ”„ Breaking down 6,220-line routes.ts file

## Phase 1: Backend Restructuring (In Progress)
### Route Organization
- `server/routes/auth.ts` - Authentication & user management
- `server/routes/jobs.ts` - Job posting, searching, applications
- `server/routes/payments.ts` - Stripe integration, financial operations
- `server/routes/messaging.ts` - Real-time chat, notifications
- `server/routes/index.ts` - Centralized route management

### Middleware Organization
- `server/middleware/security.ts` - Security, validation, sanitization

## Phase 2: Frontend Optimization (Next)
- Consolidate duplicate components
- Optimize UserDrawerV2 tabs
- Improve responsive design
- Enhance map functionality

## Phase 3: Database Optimization
- Fix type conflicts in unified storage
- Optimize queries for better performance
- Clean up schema inconsistencies

## Phase 4: Performance & Cleanup
- Remove duplicate code
- Optimize bundle size
- Improve loading times
- Clean up unused dependencies

## Goals
1. Reduce codebase complexity while maintaining 100% functionality
2. Improve maintainability through logical organization
3. Enhance performance and user experience
4. Create scalable foundation for future features
